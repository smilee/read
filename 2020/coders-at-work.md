# Summary
## Douglas Crockford

A simplifier and a tidier, Crockford invented JSON because XML seemed too complicated. He authored JavaScript: The Good Parts, arguing that JavaScript can be a decent language when used cautiously. Outspokenly criticizing the ECMAScript 4 (ES 4) proposal because it was too complicated, Crockford advocated ES3.1, which prevailed as ES5, a new name for ES3.1, became the standard over ES4. He emphasizes the importance of code reading and is concerned with how to move the Web forward.

Because JavaScript is so successful, the costs of changing it are high, argues Crockford. Because of that, it should improve more conservatively - focusing on fixing the existing defects first, rather than adding new things without thorough testing. The worst feature of JavaScript, according to Crockford, is its dependency on a global object, making it vulnerable to classic cross-site scripting attacks. He believes that the best way to improve JavaScript is to strip it down to its best features and argues that one can do serious programming in JavaScript with its closures, a Scheme heritage.

One thing that sets JavaScript apart from other languages is that it runs on anything, agnostic to compiler or runtime choices, which leads to another problem of bugs not getting fixed. Even if a new version is shipped, users may not do the required upgrade.

Crockford, who reads others' code by cleaning it, emphasizes the importance of code reading. Code reading solves two problems: keeping weak or confused programmers in sync and having brilliant programmers provide mentorship. According to Crockford, readable code is consistent in presentation and uses a subset of a language's best parts, giving it more chances of being correct. He likes Knuth and the idea of literate programming because it focuses on making code readable. Efficiency used to be crucial to Crockford when memory was small, and CPUs were slow, but he says that the current state of comparative inefficiency became okay due to Moore's Law. He prefers K&R style for braces, due to JavaScript's semicolon insertion. However, keeping everyone on the same page is more important than one's style preference.

Building flexibility into his code for future changes, Crockford still believes that code cleanup should happen every seventh sprint. With JavaScript and its soft objects, adapting objects to fit one's purpose is straightforward, although it does come with its risks. He hasn't figured out how to do unit tests in JavaScript yet but believes the best ways to test products are: (1) to have testers help developers rather than rat out developers, (2) visit customers, and hear their voices.

Crockford believes that everyone should learn to program and would like more people to learn from the history of programming languages, which progressed in the following order: machine codes, symbolic assembly languages, high-level languages, structured programming, and object-oriented programming. He stresses the importance of thinking in different programming languages and finds it unfortunate that he missed some chances to do that. His advice for aspiring programmers is: learn to read and write.

# Reflections
It would be beneficial to take a course on programming languages and learn to subset JavaScript to use.
