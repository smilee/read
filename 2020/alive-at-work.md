# Summary
Organizations should adapt to keep up with the increasing pace of change by taking advantage of people's seeking systems to encourage creativity and enthusiasm but are designed against it.

Self-expression, experimentation, and purpose — from a primary emotional system that increases the chances of survival and depends on dopamine — are crucial to activating the seeking system. When the seeking system is activated, problem-solving and creativity are improved, a long-term intrinsic motivation develops, and a sense of eudemonic happiness grows.

Many employees enter a state of learned helplessness at work due to scientific management, which encourages the deactivation of the seeking system in favor of repetitive tasks detached from a larger purpose.  Scientific management, based primarily on fear as negative emotions inhibit positive ones, was sufficient to maintain a competitive advantage when the pace of change was slow. However, today's organization depends on proactive employees with their seeking systems activated within the bounds of their organizational frame.

Stories affect behaviors. When the newcomer controls how their coworkers see them by introducing the best version of him/herself, higher performance and retention, along with a deeper connection to the organization, can be achieved. When one feels accepted the way he/she is with his/her best self activated, it also ignites his/her seeking system. For better results, have others activate one's best self.

Self-reflective titles help express employees' distinctive identity in and out of work and encourage people to see the human behind the job, increasing psychological safety. Furthermore, they make each team member's role clearer, aiding rapid decisions regarding delegation, effectively making use of diversity. Strengths-based management techniques via self-affirmation and self-expression stimulate the seeking system, and the employees are encouraged to bring their best selves to work.

Experimental safe zones that encourage play activate the seeking system and fuel people to change their mindsets, learning new behaviors. When one perceives change as a chance for experimentation and learning, rather than performance, which brings about anxiety, curiosity is triggered, and the seeking system is activated. When a transformation is required, make the expected outcome clear and provide a safe space for experimentation because the seeking system will take care of the how and the why.

Quantifiable performance metrics, such as KPIs, fuel the fear system with extrinsic rewards, inhibiting the seeking system. Learning goals are more effective than performance goals for agility and innovation because they shift the focus from the final result to discovering novel strategies. One way to activate employees' seeking systems while encouraging a learning mindset is to allow some freedom within the organization's frame to pursue personal interests.

When the leader is humble, trying to learn from employees rather than emphasizing hierarchy, positive emotions abound, leading to experimentation, instead of fear. An environment must foster feelings of uncertainty and humility rather than viewing them as a sign of weakness to encourage a learning mindset. Servant leadership brings out employee potential that otherwise would be buried and lost in learned helplessness.

Feeling purpose in one's work activates the seeking system, increasing one's enthusiasm, intrinsic motivation, and resilience. Experiencing firsthand the tangible impacts of one's work on others is a powerful way to bond with the mission at hand, increasing ownership. However, the experience must be heartfelt and personal to be effective. A leader must be sincere when attempting to instill purpose in employees to come off as inspirational rather than manipulative.

Depending on how one tells the story of what one is doing, behaviors and activities can mean different things, resulting in various outcomes. A higher level of construal when thinking about what one thinks is doing is related to why one is doing that work, while a lower construal level is related to how. The stronger the why behind one's work, its purpose with a personal aspect, the more willing one is to persevere through the difficulties it entails due to the motivation that comes with an activated seeking system. To make purpose personally meaningful, help employees experience, rather than issue, purpose.

# Reflections
To encourage performance, creativity, and engagement at work, activate the seeking system by encouraging employees to promote their best selves, providing an experimental safe zone to encourage learning rather than performance, and helping them experience their work's purpose. Although it would be great to feel alive at work, it would not be easy to convince all stakeholders to make it happen.
